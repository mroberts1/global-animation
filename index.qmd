## **Overview**

Animation has historically been seen as a sub-category of cinema primarily intended for children; yet it has been suggested that since the arrival of computer-graphic imagery (CGI) since the 1990s cinema itself has increasingly become a subset of animation with photorealistic content. This course reconsiders the place of animation in the history of motion pictures and seeks to recenter it as a fundamental component of cinema itself.

Beginning with optical toys such as the zoetrope and the time-motion experiments of Marey and Muybridge, it then considers the origins of animated cinema in the 1920s and 1930s, from the early cartoons of Disney and Fleischer to the groundbreaking silhouette animation of Lotte Reiniger in Germany.

Particular attention is given to the role of music in the historical development of animation, from the visual music of Oscar Fischinger to Disney’s _Fantasia_ and Raymond Scott’s soundtracks to the Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoons of the 1940-1950s.

The course then turns to the wave of experimental animation in Russia, Czechoslovakia (Švankmajer), and Poland from the 1950-1980s, and its later impact on contemporary avant-garde animators such as the Quay Brothers. Parallel to this, it also considers the rise of anime in Japan, from the first anime franchise, Tezuka Osama’s _Astro Boy_, to Studio Ghibli and the emergence of global fandom for Japanese anime since the 1970s.

From the 1990s, the course considers the transformation of animation by digital technologies, including the shift from 2D to 3D animation in the movies of Pixar and Dreamworks; the stop-motion claymation of British animator Nick Park; and the digital puppetry of motion capture and green-screening.

Returning to the present, it considers the ongoing transformation of the animation industry by today’s algorithmic tools (AI) and the new wave of generative animation.

Through this global overview of the history of animation, the course seeks to demonstrate that far from being marginal to the history of cinema, animation has in fact been one of its fundamental principles all along.

----------

## **Outcomes**

By the end of the course, students will:

-   have acquired a detailed understanding of the global history of animation as a media form;
-   understand differences between drawn 2D (cel) animation and digital animation, as well as the different aesthetics associated with these;
-   be able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in animation industries using relevant analytical concepts.
